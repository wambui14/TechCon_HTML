           <h2> History: The Origins and Evolution of TechCon</h2>
           <p>TechCon was founded in 2016 by a small group of passionate developers, educators, and tech entrepreneurs who shared a vision — to create a platform where innovation, collaboration, and learning could thrive. What started as a local meetup in Nairobi quickly gained momentum, drawing in a diverse community of technologists eager to share ideas and push boundaries.
            As the tech world evolved, so did TechCon. From its humble beginnings, the event grew into a major annual conference, attracting thought leaders, industry pioneers, and thousands of attendees from around the world. Over the years, TechCon has showcased everything from the rise of mobile development and cloud computing to the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and immersive technologies.
            Now in its 8th year, TechCon stands as a global symbol of innovation, growth, and community. Each conference builds on the legacy of the last, continuing to inspire a new generation of thinkers, builders, and change-makers who are shaping the future of technology.
